# FROM-Subqueries

This repository contains practical examples of FROM subqueries in SQL (also known as inline views or virtual tables).

## 📚 What I Learned

By working on this repository, I learned how to:

- Use FROM subqueries to create virtual tables
- Combine FROM subqueries with WHERE clauses
- Join FROM subqueries with other tables using JOIN
- Create calculated columns inside FROM subqueries
- Use aliases to reference subquery results
- Write nested (multi-level) FROM subqueries

Build complex SQL queries using aggregations and calculated columns

## 📂 Included Topics

The repository includes examples of:

- FROM Subquery + WHERE
- FROM Subquery + JOIN
- FROM Subquery + Calculated Column
- FROM Subquery as a Virtual Table (Alias)
- FROM Subquery + GROUP BY + Aggregation
- FROM Subquery + Nested Subquery
- FROM Subquery + Complex Aggregation + Calculated Column

Each `.sql` file demonstrates a specific use case of FROM subqueries in real-world query scenarios.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen advanced SQL query-writing skills
- Practice structuring complex queries using subqueries
- Prepare for SQL exams and technical interviews
- Build a well-organized SQL portfolio on GitHub

## 🛠 Technologies

- SQL (T-SQL compatible)
